<section id="clear">
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day <br>
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. <br>
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town<br> 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. <br>
<br>
Home<br>
Home again<br>
I like to be here<br>
When I can<br>
<br>
When I come home<br>
Cold and tired<br>
It's good to warm my bones<br>
Beside the fire<br>
<br>
Far away<br>
Across the field<br>
The tolling of the iron bell<br>
Calls the faithful to their knees<br>
To hear the softly spoken magic spell
